Welcome! Here is a My Age Calculator project I built on LearnStreet's Code Garage using python.

Project description
-------------------------

The Age Calculator project displays information regarding entered data. It can display days left, hours left, and seconds left until one's birthday based on input. <br>
It handles leap years and accurate calculations by the current time.
